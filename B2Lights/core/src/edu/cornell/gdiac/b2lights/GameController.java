/*
 * GameController.java
 *
 * This combines the WorldController with the mini-game specific PlatformController
 * in the last lab.  With that said, some of the work is now offloaded to the new
 * LevelModel class, which allows us to serialize and deserialize a level. 
 * 
 * This is a refactored version of WorldController from Lab 4.  It separate the 
 * level out into a new class called LevelModel.  This model is, in turn, read
 * from a JSON file.
